TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_3 = "Before we can place a harvester on these resource nodes, we need to cover them with infestation.  We can create infestation by placing cysts.  Try placing a cyst near the resource node in Gravity Control now."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_5 = "It will take a few moments before this \"cyst chain\" is fully built and spreading infestation.  While we wait, build another chain of cysts leading up to the other natural expansion, in Plaza."
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_6 = "While we wait for the infestation to spread, we should choose an upgrade path for our hive.  There are 3 upgrade paths to choose from: Crag, Shade, and Shift.  Crag favors toughness and survivability; Shade favors stealth and deception; and Shift favors speed and evasion.  Select the hive and upgrade it to a Shift hive."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_12 = "This gorge tunnel is in a critical location on the map, and therefore we should do everything we can to help our team hold this territory.  Build a Crag on the infestation near the gorge tunnel."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_45 = "The new hive has just finished building.  The completed hive means we get one additional level of biomass, bringing the total to 3.  Level 3 biomass unlocks many new abilities, but they still must be researched before players can use them.  Select a hive, and begin researching the \"Metabolize\" ability for our Fade."
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_46 = "Good.  Since we have two hives, we can research two abilities at once.  Select the other hive, and begin researching \"Bile Bomb\", a Gorge ability."
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_47 = "While we wait for those abilities to finish researching, we can work on our second set of upgrades.  Select the new hive, and upgrade it to a Shade hive."
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_48 = "Now we should try to conceal our presence in this room a little better.  Build a Shade."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_51 = "The ink ability not only clouds marines' vision, but also disrupts the targeting systems of ARCs, buying us valuable time -- but we can't keep it up forever!  The ARCs need to be destroyed, quickly!"
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_52 = "We've run out of eggs!  Hives spawn eggs on their own, but very slowly.  We need to spawn eggs faster to defend this hive!  Select the hive in Hydroanalysis, and hatch some eggs."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_54 = "Each upgraded hive enables a unique ability for the drifter.  Since we have a Shade Hive, our drifters can create hallucinations.  Create a hallucination cloud on the group of aliens."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_60 = "The marines have a phase gate in Plaza!  This is bad."
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_61 = "And things just got a whole lot worse!  It looks like marines are throwing everything they've got at us up north.  It's only a matter of time now before they attack our main base, and it is unlikely that we will be able to defend against such a strong attack."
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_62 = "Instead, we'll need to take out something of theirs.  Your teammates are forming a pack to counterattack the marine base.  Get your drifter away from the marines, and use it to help the counterattack."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_66 = "The most important thing you can do as a commander is communicate!  If you're unsure of how something works, or don't know what to do: ask your teammates.  The fastest way to get ejected from the command chair is to be silent and do nothing."

TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_81 = "We need another source of infestation for this area.  Select the tunnel, and upgrade it to an \"Infested Tunnel\"."
TUTORIAL_SILVER_COMMANDER_ALIEN_82 = "This upgrade will create infestation at both ends of the tunnel."
